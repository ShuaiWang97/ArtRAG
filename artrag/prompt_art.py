Given a visual art related text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

"Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch painter who became a pivotal figure in Post-Impressionism. His expressive brushwork, bold colors, and emotive use of light set him apart from other artists of his time. 

Van Gogh was heavily influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, which he encountered in Paris and incorporated into his work through simplified lines and vivid colors. The themes of loneliness and suffering are common in his works, reflecting his turbulent life. 

Though he was unrecognized during his lifetime, van Gogh's work gained immense appreciation after his death, influencing many 20th-century Expressionist artists."################

"The Renaissance was a period of cultural rebirth in Europe, spanning the 14th to the 17th centuries. Centered in Italy, it marked a revival of interest in classical Greek and Roman ideas, leading to significant developments in art, science, and philosophy. 

Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were pioneers of Renaissance art, known for their mastery of techniques such as linear perspective, which created a sense of depth in paintings. The Renaissance emphasized themes of humanism, exploring the human form, individualism, and the natural world. 

This period laid the groundwork for future Western art traditions."

"Surrealism emerged in the early 20th century, led by artists such as Salvador Dalí and André Breton. This movement sought to release the creative potential of the unconscious mind, often through bizarre and dreamlike imagery. 

Surrealist techniques included automatism, where artists created works without conscious thought, allowing subconscious impulses to guide the process. Surrealism was deeply influenced by the psychological theories of Sigmund Freud,
